# GitHub Actions Release Fix

## Problem
The GitHub Actions workflow was failing with the error:
```
Error: Resource not accessible by integration
```

This error occurs when GitHub Actions doesn't have sufficient permissions to create releases.

## Root Causes
1. **Missing workflow-level permissions** - The workflow didn't have `contents: write` permission
2. **Deprecated actions** - Using `actions/create-release@v1` which is deprecated
3. **Complex workflow structure** - Separate jobs for creating release and uploading assets

## Solution

### 1. Added Workflow-Level Permissions
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  packages: write
```

### 2. Updated to Modern Actions
**Before:**
```yaml
- uses: actions/create-release@v1  # Deprecated
- uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1  # Deprecated
```

**After:**
```yaml
- uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1  # Modern, maintained
```

### 3. Simplified Workflow Structure
**Before:**
- Separate `create-release` job
- Separate `build-and-upload` job
- Complex dependency management

**After:**
- Single `build-and-upload` job
- Release creation and asset upload in one step
- Automatic release creation if it doesn't exist

### 4. Enhanced Release Features
```yaml
- name: Create Release and Upload Asset
  uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
  with:
    tag_name: ${{ github.ref_name }}
    name: Release ${{ github.ref_name }}
    draft: false
    prerelease: false
    generate_release_notes: true  # Automatic release notes
    files: |
      bin/MathReX-${{ matrix.goos }}-${{ matrix.goarch }}${{ matrix.asset_name_suffix }}
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Proper Permissions** - Workflow has necessary write permissions
2. **Modern Actions** - Using actively maintained actions
3. **Simplified Structure** - Fewer jobs, less complexity
4. **Better UX** - Automatic release notes generation
5. **Reliability** - More robust release creation process

## Testing

To test the fix:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix GitHub Actions permissions and update to modern actions"
git tag v1.5.0
git push origin main
git push origin v1.5.0
```

The workflow should now successfully:
1. Create a release for the tag
2. Build applications for all platforms
3. Upload built assets to the release
4. Generate automatic release notes

## Benefits

- **No more permission errors**
- **Automatic release creation**
- **Better release notes**
- **Simplified maintenance**
- **Future-proof with modern actions**
